Recreated in NextJS project. First started on layout using Tailwind and some custom CSS. Did validation for input fields, where each input field cannot be negative. For bill, you cannot enter more after two values from the decimal points. For custom, you cannot enter the same tip percent as the buttons. Afterwards, created functions for the calculations. Did responsiveness and active states last.
